## Security Notes

### Git Remote Token

**⚠️ PRIVATE WORKSPACE ONLY**

The git remote URL contains an access token:
```
https://x-access-token:ghs_ic8DkLhuzYPi1hztsdCa28HnhpYRUx3EVpDl@github.com/...
```

**Status:**
- ✅ Token is in `.git/config` only (not committed to source)
- ✅ No secrets in source code
- ⚠️ Do NOT push `.git/config` to public repositories
- ⚠️ Consider rotating token after deployment

**Action:** No code changes needed, environment issue only
