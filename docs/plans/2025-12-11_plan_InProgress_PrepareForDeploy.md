# Prepare for Deployment Plan

**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Created:** 2025-12-11  
**Branch:** cursor/review-and-prepare-for-deployment-6560  
**Progress:** Assessment complete, agent work done, awaiting user actions

---

## Plan Lifecycle

This document tracks the ENTIRE deployment preparation effort from assessment through publication:

1. ✅ **Plan Phase** - Define what deployment readiness means
2. ✅ **Assessment Phase** - Evaluate current state, identify gaps
3. ✅ **Agent Work Phase** - Fix agent-addressable issues, create supporting docs
4. ⏳ **User Action Phase** - User adds LICENSE, updates package.json (CURRENT)
5. ⏳ **Verification Phase** - Package, test, and publish
6. ⏳ **Completion** - Extension live on VS Code Marketplace

**This plan will be marked `done` only when the extension is successfully published.**

---

## Executive Summary

The codebase is production-ready with excellent architecture and comprehensive test coverage. All 357 tests pass, code compiles without errors, and documentation is comprehensive.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Phase 1-3 Complete: Assessment, agent work, and LICENSE creation finished
- ⏳ Phase 4 Pending: User must update package.json metadata
- ⏳ Phase 5-6 Pending: Package, test, and publish

This plan tracks all work needed to publish to VS Code Marketplace.

## Security Notes

### Git Remote Token

#### ⚠️ PRIVATE WORKSPACE ONLY

The git remote URL contains an access token:

```bash
https://x-access-token:ghs_ic8DkLhuzYPi1hztsdCa28HnhpYRUx3EVpDl@github.com/...
```

**Status:**
- ✅ Token is in `.git/config` only (not committed to source)
- ✅ No secrets in source code
- ⚠️ Do NOT push `.git/config` to public repositories
- ⚠️ Consider rotating token after deployment

**Action:** No code changes needed, environment issue only
